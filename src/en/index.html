        <h2>Manifesto</h2>
        <p>A humorous take on systems that refuse to work as intended. Each point is a valuable insight from an
            experienced expert, forming part of the philosophy of "Failing Architecture".</p>
        <ul>
            <li>“It’ll do for now” —

                <br>
                <small>Decisions are made quickly
                    with minimal effort. As long as it "works," it's fine.</small>
            </li>
            <li>“Why is it so expensive?!” — 
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eldar-pmp/">Eldar Musin</a>
                <br>
                <small>Quality and
                    reliability are sacrificed in favor of cost savings.</small>
            </li>
            <li>“Why is it taking so long? We need it now” — 
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/artyom-prima/">Artyom Prima</a>
                <br>
                <small>Speed trumps readiness, even if the system isn't launch-ready.</small>
            </li>
            <li>“We’ll rewrite it later” —

                <small>Long-term
                    planning is traded for quick results.</small>
            </li>
            <li>“Launched once. It crashed. You forgot” —

                <small>System stability is a secondary concern.</small>
            </li>
            <li>"Load balancing that balances only problems" —

                <br>
                <small>Errors are evenly distributed across all nodes.</small>
            </li>
            <li>"Monitoring and alerts that trigger only after a crash" —

                <br>
                <small>Configurations are so complex that no one can locate them.</small>
            </li>
            <li>"Test environments that work only during tests" — 
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saykhan/">Saikhan

                <small>Test environments are perfect, but production reveals surprises.</small>
